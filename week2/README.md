# Week 2 process

Created an iterative pattern using Pixi.js.

Here is a snippet of my code that I am proud of:
```typescript
 for (let y = 20; y < window.innerHeight; y += 108) {
    for (let x = 30; x < window.innerWidth - 100; x += 100) {
      draw.beginFill(0x533e42, 1);
      draw.drawRect(x, y, 100, 15);
    }
  }
  
```
