# Advanced Creative Coding Midterm Project

## Overview

For my midterm, I created a landscape scene and users can navigate around the scene through a peephole. When the user clicks down anywhere on the screen, the whole scene is revealed with a different frame instead of a peephole. I applied a displacement filter to the clouds to make them look like water ripples and I also applied a glitch filter to the moon sprite. For the movement of the waves, I used tweens to animate them.

## Initial Concept

My original idea was a more simplified version of this which was to just create a landscape scene. I ended up feeling like the scene was too static so I ended up adding more elements/effects.

## Further Development

I want to add a screenshot functionality that will only take a screenshot of the view within the polaroid film. I also want to add audio to the scene to play as background music.
