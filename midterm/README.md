# Advanced Creative Coding Midterm Project

## Overview

For my midterm, I created a landscape scene and users can navigate around the scene through a peep-hole. When the user clicks down anywhere on the screen, the whole scene is revealed with a frame instead of a peep-hole. I applied a displacement filter to the clouds to make them look like water ripples. I also applied a glitch filter to the moon sprite.

## Initial Concept

My original idea was to create a scene of a moon and the ocean. I ended up adding more elements like the peep-hole/frame and filters.

## Further Development

I want to add a screenshot functionality that will only take a screenshot of the view within the polaroid film.
