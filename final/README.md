## Overview

For my final project, I made a 3D ocean landscape. For the backgrounds of the scene, I loaded images as a texture inside the cube. For creating the water component of my scene, I referenced (Ken Kozma's tutorial)[https://www.liquid.fish/current/threejs]. You can move the character around with the arrow keys. I added 3 spheres in the scene that will change the scene when the user comes in contact with them. You can also add fishes to the scene using the "Q" key or delete them using the "W" key.

## Further Development

For further development, I would add different background noises to the different scenes. I also want to animate the fishes in the scene to move around.

## Technologies

- Three.js
- TypeScript
