## Overview

For my final project, I made a 3D ocean landscape. For the backgrounds of the scene, I loaded images as a texture inside the cube. For creating the water component of my scene, I referenced (Ken Kozma's tutorial)[https://www.liquid.fish/current/threejs]. You can move the character around with the arrow keys. I added 3 spheres in the scene that will change the scene when the user comes in contact with them.
