# Week 12: Final Concept

## Overview

For my final concept I wanted to create an interactive 3D scene. I wanted to have a character be able to navigate through the scene and I wanted to make a the environment on water. I'm planning on adding either GLTF/OBJ objects or three.js primitives throughout the scene that will respond to the character bumping into it like changing the color of the sky. I want to make this using Three.js and using the keyboard for interaction.
